<h2>Playing competitive cricket</h2>
<p>There are over 1,000 cricket clubs and more than 100,000 registered cricketers in Victoria. So playing competitive cricket is a popular way to keep fit and have fun.</p>

<h3>Before you decide whether competitive cricket is right for you, remember that:</h3>

<p>Cricket is a team sport. It’s important you are up for some company and for communicating with others.</p>
<p>Cricket clubs will mostly hold matches on the weekends, both Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
<p>Playing competitive cricket usually involves committing to regular matches or practice sessions.</p>
<p>Umpiring and scoring are other ways to become actively involved in competitive cricket.</p>
<h3>Cricket costs and equipment</h3>
<p>If you want to start playing competitive cricket, you’ll need to join a club. This will often mean you will have to pay club membership and competition fees. For competitions, you will also need to buy pants and shirts to play in (cricket whites) and cricket spikes (shoes with spikes) for playing on the turf.</p>
