	<p>I read eight regional newspapers daily. I do make separate new

	<h3>Watching cricket</h3>
	<p>I do watch cricket. My favorite team is India. My all-time favorite cricketer is Sachin Tendulkar.
	My current favorite crickets are Virat Kohli, Subman Gill and
		Root.</p>
<p>I recently watched India vs Srilanka ODI match. Both Virat and subhuman gill scored centuries in that match. Srilanka lost that match. India recorded a world record for that ever team win with 300+ runs.</p>
