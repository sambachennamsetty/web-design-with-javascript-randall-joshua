      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Online loan Management System (OLMS) is a project which is taken and being developed 
by our team which helps people to apply for loans online. Customers need to enter loan 
applications online. Only Staff or admin has the authority to approve or reject loan applications. 
Customer can view their Loan account details, Interest rate, repayment schedule details, etc. 
Customers can make loan payments online as well. After the payment, the system updates with 
the total paid amount and the balance amount. Administrators can view payment details, loan 
account details, pending payment details, and do terminate the accounts, etc. </p>

<ul>
<li>Admin is the one who verifies the user or the customer who is going to register on the 
loan management system. There can be only one account of admin and all other accounts 
can be either of user or customer.</li>
<li> After verifying the customerâ€™s loan request admin can approve the loan and the respected 
information will be updated in the system with the calculated interest amount. And admin 
can be able to update customer profiles and add or delete accounts.</li>
<li> A customer must register him/herself in the application to apply for any type of loan such 
as a home loan, study loan, car loan, etc. Once customer registration is completed, he can 
log in with the given credentials in the user module.</li>
<li>Once the customer has logged in and he/she has made a loan request with the amount, 
duration, and interest rate. Then Customers loan request goes to the admin module, and 
if it gets approved, the requested information for that customer will get updated in the 
system.</li></ul>

<h2>Business Model</h2>
<p>The business model we choose for the project are Happy Money Loan Provider [1], 
PenFed Credit Union [2], and Light Stream Loans [3]. Which provides loans to the customers 
online based on their credit card score. With digital transformation assuming a faster pace, 
loan management software is gaining wider adoption. Faster and more efficient than the 
legacy lending system, loan software helps automate every stage of the loan lifecycle, from 
application to closing. We are interested to know how they make the business in the backend 
and work to grow their organization high and keep being a leading loan provider in the USA.
